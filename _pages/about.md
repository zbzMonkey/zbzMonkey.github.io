I am Bingzhen Zhao, a student who is majored in neuroscience. I want to know more about the mechanism of learning and memory, attentions and emotions. I also want to learn something aboout engineering so that I can design some products to help ppeople with neuron system disorders if possible.
I am currently at [Wenlab, the school of life sciences, University of Science and Technology of China](http://en.biox.ustc.edu.cn/). Now I work to find how the sensory information integrate in C.elegans.
