I am Bingzhen Zhao, a student who is majored in neuroscience. I want to know more about the mechanism of learning and memory, attention and emotion. I also want to learn something about engineering so that I can design some products to help people with neuron system disorders if possible.
I am currently at [Wenlab, the school of life sciences, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](http://en.biox.ustc.edu.cn/). Now I am working to find how the sensory information integrate in C.elegans.

I am preparing to graduate from USTC. It is a great time these two years. I have learned a lot and made some good friends.  
I am now applying for a PhD program. Hope I can find another good place to keep improving myself.
