​I'm Bingzhen Zhao, a neuroscience major with a keen interest in understanding the mechanisms underlying decision-making, attention, and emotion. Additionally, I'm eager to explore engineering principles to design products that could assist individuals with nervous system disorders.​ Currently, I am a member of Dr. Nuo Li's lab at Duke University. My research focuses on to investigate the driving sources of decision variable. We develope methods to help us understand the invisible process inside brain during decision-making which is pretty exciting.
